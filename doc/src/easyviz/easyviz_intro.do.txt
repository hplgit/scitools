Easyviz is a unified interface to various packages for scientific
visualization and plotting.  The Easyviz interface is written in
Python with the purpose of making it very easy to visualize data in
Python scripts. Both curve plots and more advanced 2D/3D visualization
of scalar and vector fields are supported.  The Easyviz interface was
designed with three ideas in mind: 1) a simple, Matlab-like syntax; 2)
a unified interface to lots of visualization engines (called backends
later): Gnuplot, Matplotlib, Grace, Veusz, Pmw.Blt.Graph, PyX,
Matlab, VTK, VisIt, OpenDX; and 3) a minimalistic interface which
offers only basic control of plots: curves, linestyles, legends,
title, axis extent and names.  More fine-tuning of plots can be done
by invoking backend-specific commands.

Easyviz was made back in 2005/2006 so that one can postpone the choice
of a particular visualization package (and its special associated
syntax). This is often useful when you quickly need to visualize
curves or 2D/3D fields in your Python program, but haven't really
decided which plotting tool to go for. As Python is gaining popularity
at universities, students are often forced to continuously switch
between Matlab and Python, which is straightforward for array
computing, but (previously) annoying for plotting. Easyviz was
therefore also made to ease the switch between Python and Matlab. In
recent years, Matplotlib has emerged as the standard plotting package
for Python, and Matplotlib offers a Matlab-like interface. Many will
prefer to use Matplotlib and its rich documentation directly rather
than going through the more limited Easyviz interface (and having the
flexibility to use other plotting engines).

===== Guiding Principles =====

__First principle.__ Array data can be plotted with a minimal
set of keystrokes using a Matlab-like syntax. A simple

!bc pycod
t = linspace(0, 3, 51)    # 51 points between 0 and 3
y = t**2*exp(-t**2)
plot(t, y)
!ec
plots the data in (the NumPy array) `t` versus the data in (the NumPy
array) `y`. If you need legends, control of the axis, as well as
additional curves, all this is obtained by the standard Matlab-style
commands
!bc pycod
y2 = t**4*exp(-t**2)
# pick out each 4 points and add random noise:
t3 = t[::4]
y3 = y2[::4] + random.normal(loc=0, scale=0.02, size=len(t3))

plot(t, y1, 'r-')
hold('on')
plot(t, y2, 'b-')
plot(t3, y3, 'bo')
legend('t^2*exp(-t^2)', 't^4*exp(-t^2)', 'data')
title('Simple Plot Demo')
axis([0, 3, -0.05, 0.6])
xlabel('t')
ylabel('y')
show()

hardcopy('tmp0.eps')  # this one can be included in LaTeX
hardcopy('tmp0.png')  # this one can be included in HTML
!ec
Easyviz also allows these additional function calls to be executed
as a part of the `plot` call:
!bc pycod
plot(t, y1, 'r-', t, y2, 'b-', t3, y3, 'bo',
     legend=('t^2*exp(-t^2)', 't^4*exp(-t^2)', 'data'),
     title='Simple Plot Demo',
     axis=(0, 3, -0.05, 0.6),
     xlabel='t', ylabel='y',
     hardcopy='tmp1.eps',
     show=True)

hardcopy('tmp0.png')
!ec
A scalar function $f(x,y)$ may be visualized
as an elevated surface with colors using these commands:
!bc pycod
x = linspace(-2, 2, 41)  # 41 point on [-2, 2]
xv, yv = ndgrid(x, x)    # define a 2D grid with points (xv,yv)
values = f(xv, yv)       # function values
surfc(xv, yv, values,
      shading='interp',
      clevels=15,
      clabels='on',
      hidden='on',
      show=True)
!ec

__Second princple.__ Easyviz is just a unified interface to other
plotting packages that can be called from Python. Such plotting
packages are referred to as backends. Several backends are supported:
Gnuplot, Matplotlib, Grace (Xmgr), Veusz, Pmw.Blt.Graph, PyX, Matlab,
VTK, VisIt, OpenDX. In other words, scripts that use Easyviz commands
only, can work with a variety of backends, depending on what you have
installed on the machine in question and what quality of the plots you
demand. For example, switching from Gnuplot to Matplotlib is trivial.

Scripts with Easyviz commands will most probably run anywhere since at
least the Gnuplot package can always be installed right away on any
platform. In practice this means that when you write a script to
automate investigation of a scientific problem, you can always quickly
plot your data with Easyviz (i.e., Matlab-like) commands and postpone
to marry any specific plotting tool. Most likely, the choice of
plotting backend can remain flexible. This will also allow old scripts
to work with new fancy plotting packages in the future if Easyviz
backends are written for those packages.

__Third principle.__ The Easyviz interface is minimalistic, aimed at
rapid prototyping of plots. This makes the Easyviz code easy to read
and extend (e.g., with new backends). If you need more sophisticated
plotting, like controlling tickmarks, inserting annotations, etc., you
must grab the backend object and use the backend-specific syntax to
fine-tune the plot. The idea is that you can get away with Easyviz and
a plotting package-independent script "95 percent" of the time - only
now and then there will be demand for package-dependent code for
fine-tuning and customization of figures.

These three principles and the Easyviz implementation make simple things
simple and unified, and complicated things are not more complicated than
they would otherwise be. You can always start out with the simple
commands - and jump to complicated fine-tuning only when strictly needed.
