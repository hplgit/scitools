Easyviz comes with the SciTools package, so to install Easyviz, you
must install SciTools, which is available from
"Google code": "http://code.google.com/p/scitools".

If you run a Linux system that allows installation from Debian
repositories (Ubuntu is such a Linux system), you get SciTools, NumPy, and
Gnuplot with one Unix command:
!bc sys
Unix> sudo apt-get install python-scitools
!ec
because SciTools is in standard Debian. You probably want to be able
to plot with other packages than Gnuplot as well. In addition, it
is convenient to have ImageMagick installed for conversion between
plot file formats and some encoders for videos. Here is a suggested
list for installation on Debian systems:
!bc sys
Unix> sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib python-tk python-scipy python-scientific imagemagick netpbm ffmpeg python-pyx python-pmw.blt python-vtk dx grace
!ec


Otherwise, you download the tarball with the SciTools software, pack it out,
go the `scitools` folder, and run the standard command
!bc
Unix/DOS> python setup.py install
!ec
Easyviz is reached as the package `scitools.easyviz` and can be
imported in several ways (see the paragraph heading
"Importing Just Easyviz" in the Tutorial).

Easyviz will not work unless you have one or more plotting programs
correctly installed. Below, we have collected some brief information
on installing various programs. (Note that if you do an `apt-get
install python-scitools` all necessary plotting programs are
automatically installed for you.)

Please check your plotting program independently of Easyviz, as
described in the *Check Your Backends!* section of the *Troubleshooting*
chapter, if you encounter strange errors during Easyviz plotting.

===== Installing Gnuplot =====

===== Linux/Unix =====

__Compile from Source.__
Gnuplot can be downloaded from gnuplot.sourceforge.net. It builds
easily on most Unix systems. You also need the `Gnuplot` Python
module, which can be obtained from `gnuplot-py.sourceforge.net`.

__Debian/Ubuntu.__
Prebuilt versions are available for Debian/Ubuntu:
run
!bc
apt-get install gnuplot gnuplot-x11 python-gnuplot
!ec
but running these commands are not necessary since on Debian/Ubuntu you
will install `python-scitools` which effectively installs all the
software that SciTools depend on.

===== Windows =====

On Windows, one can either use Gnuplot under Cygwin or use a precompiled
binary from sourgeforce.net.

__Using the Gnuplot Cygwin package.__
In this case there are two things that needs to be changed in the
`gp_cygwin.py` file in the top-level directory of the `Gnuplot.py`
source tree. First you need to change the `gnuplot_command` variable
to `gnuplot` instead of `pgnuplot.exe`. Then you should change the
`default_term` variable to `x11` instead of `windows` since the
Gnuplot Cygwin package is not compiled with the Windows
terminal. Finally, install `Gnuplot.py` (`python setup.py install`)
and launch X11 by running `startx` from a Cygwin prompt. Try to run
the `test.py` script that comes with `Gnuplot.py`. If everything
works, Easyviz can use Gnuplot.

__Using Gnuplot Binaries.__

First download the Gnuplot 4.2.4 binaries for Windows (or a newer version)
A possible URL is
!bc
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/gnuplot/gp424win32.zip
!ec
The zip file may have another name for a newer version of Gnuplot on
Windows.

Then unzip the `gp424win32.zip` file to the folder
!bc
C:\gnuplot
!ec
Add the folder name
!bc
C:\gnuplot\bin
!ec
to the `PATH` environment variable (this is done in a graphical interface for
setting environment variables).

Check out the latest SVN revision of the Python interface to
Gnuplot, which is the Python module file `Gnuplot.py`:
!bc
svn co https://gnuplot-py.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gnuplot-py/trunk/gnuplot-py
!ec

Install `Gnuplot.py`:
!bc
cd gnuplot-py
python setup.py bdist_wininst
dist\gnuplot-py-1.8+.win32.exe
!ec

Check out the latest SVN revision of SciTools:
!bc
svn co http://scitools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ scitools
!ec

Install SciTools:
!bc
cd scitools
python setup.py bdist_wininst
dist\SciTools-0.4.win32.exe
!ec
(The SciTools version number differs.)

===== Installing Matplotlib =====

This is normally just a matter of
!bc
python setup.py install
!ec
in the root directory of the Matplotlib code.

__Windows.__
You can download prebuilt binaries from the Matplotlib home page.
